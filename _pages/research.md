Here are some of my key research projects:

## Large Language Models (LLMs) in Finance

* **Sentiment Analysis**: Worked on applying LLMs for sentiment analysis in financial contexts.
* **Stock Predictions**: Developing a model based on LLMs to make stock predictions.

## Materials Science

### Photoluminescence in Rare-earth-based Materials
* Developed an automated modification for DFT calculation, non-self-consistent field (nSCF), Raman spectroscopy, and Photoluminescence (PL) shift analysis.
* Currently authoring a research paper on these findings.

### Superconductivity
* Synthesized pure samples of Li3Re3Te2O12 and Pb9Cu(PO4)6O.
* Performed X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis and levitation experiments to assess superconductivity.
* Developed a novel synthesis recipe with an altered ratio, leading to significant findings.
* Preparing a manuscript for publication.
